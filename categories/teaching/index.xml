      <description>supervisions   I am currently supervising - together with Olga Kuryatnikova and Wilco van den Heuvel - the PhD project of Marten Soer. The project lies at the intersection of Statistics and Operations Research, and the main focus directions will be reducing computational time by exploiting the structure of problems (e.g., sparsity ) and applying advanced optimization techniques (enhanced gradient descent, integer programming algorithms tailored to a specific problem); increasing the applicability of models to noisy and unseen data by using robust and stochastic optimization; and, allowing constraints on model parameters.</description>

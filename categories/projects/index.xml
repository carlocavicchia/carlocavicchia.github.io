Second-Order Disjoint Exploratory Factor Analysis
Hierarchical models are often considered to measure latent concepts defining nested set of manifest variables. Therefore, by supposing a hierarchical relationship among manifest variables, the general latent concept can be represented by a tree-structure where each internal node represents a specific level (order) of abstraction for the latent concept measured. In this paper, we propose a new latent factor model called Second-order Disjoint Exploratory Factor Analysis in order to model an unknown hierarchical structure of the manifest variables with two orders.</description>

      <description>I am a statistician and my research is focused on the methodological and computational aspects of data analysis. The best feeling is when I can use my knowledge to solve pratical and real problems. I am currently working on latent variable models, unsupervised classification and model-based composite indicators.

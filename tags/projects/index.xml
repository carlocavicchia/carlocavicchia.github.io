      <description>my current researches are:
  Cavicchia, C., Vichi, M. and Zaccaria, G.
The ultrametric correlation matrix for modelling hierarchical latent concepts
the aim of the paper is to reconstruct an observed data correlation matrix of manifest variables through an ultrametric correlation matrix which is able to pinpoint the hierarchical nature of the phenomenon under study; we introduce a novel model which detects consistent latent concepts and their relationships starting from the observed correlation matrix.</description>

      <description>I am a statistician and my research is focused on the methodological and computational aspects of data analysis. The best feeling is when I can use my knowledge to solve pratical and real problems. I am currently working on latent variable models, unsupervised classification and model-based composite indicators.

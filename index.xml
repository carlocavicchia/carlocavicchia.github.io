      <description>my current researches are:
  Cavicchia, C. and Vichi, M.
Second-Order Disjoint Exploratory Factor Analysis
a new latent factor model called Second-order Disjoint Exploratory Factor Analysis in order to model an unknown hierarchical structure of the manifest variables with two orders. It is an exploratory second-order factor analysis, which is nested and estimated simultaneously by maximum likelihood method via a cyclic block coordinate descent algorithm.

      <description>I am a statistician and my research is focused on the methodological and computational aspects of data analysis. The best feeling is when I can use my knowledge to solve pratical and real problems. I am currently working on latent variable models, unsupervised classification and model-based composite indicators.

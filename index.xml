      <description>I am a statistician and my research is focused on the methodological and computational aspects of data analysis. The best feeling is when I can use my knowledge to solve practical and real problems. I am currently working on latent variable models, unsupervised classification and model-based composite indicators.

      <description>my current researches are:
  Cavicchia, C. and Vichi, M.
Second-order Disjoint Factor Analysis
a new latent factor model called Second-order Disjoint Factor Analysis in order to model an unknown hierarchical structure of the manifest variables with two orders. This is an second-order factor analysis, which - respect to the second-order confirmatory factor analysis - is exploratory, nested and estimated simultaneously by maximum likelihood method. A cyclic block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to maximize the likelihood.</description>

      <description>I am a statistician and my research is focused on the methodological and computational aspects of data analysis. The best feeling is when I can use my knowledge to solve practical and real problems. I am currently working on latent variable models, unsupervised classification and model-based composite indicators.

      <description>my current researches are:
  Cavicchia, C., Vichi, M. and Zaccaria, G.
Gaussian mixture model with an extended ultrametric covariance structure
the maximum likelihood estimation of a Gaussian Mixture Model where the covariance structure is modeled according to an extended ultrametric covariance matrix, the model extends the concepts and definitions of ultrametric matrix in order to model generic covariance structure. (Revision requested)

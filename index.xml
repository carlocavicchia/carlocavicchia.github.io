      <description>I am a statistician and my research is focused on the methodological and computational aspects of data analysis. The best feeling is when I can use my knowledge to solve practical and real problems. I am currently working on latent variable models, unsupervised classification and model-based composite indicators.

      <description>supervisions   I am currently supervising five msc theses in Econometrics and three msc theses in Data Science for Marketing Analytics at Erasmus School of Economics
  this year I am second assessor of three msc theses in Econometrics, three msc theses in Data Science for Marketing Analytics and five bsc theses in Econometrics at Erasmus School of Economics
  in the past few years I supervised three msc theses in Econometrics (on mixed-type data clustering methods and latent dirichlet allocation), three msc theses in Data Science for Marketing Analytics (on supervised machine learning methods), and nineteen bsc theses in Econometrics (on Cavicchia, Vichi and Zaccaria (2022), Adachi and Trendafilov (2018), Vichi and Kiers (2001) and Bluszcz (2016)) at Erasmus School of Economics</description>

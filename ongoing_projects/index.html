<strong>Second-Order Disjoint Exploratory Factor Analysis</strong><br>
<em>Hierarchical models are often considered to measure latent concepts defining nested set of manifest variables. Therefore, by supposing a hierarchical relationship among manifest variables, the general latent concept can be represented by a tree-structure where each internal node represents a specific level (order) of abstraction for the latent concept measured.
In this paper, we propose a new latent factor model called Second-order Disjoint Exploratory Factor Analysis in order to model an unknown hierarchical structure of the manifest variables with two orders. It is an exploratory second-order factor analysis, which - respect to the classical second order confirmatory factor analysis - is exploratory, nested and estimated simultaneously by maximum likelihood method. Each subset of manifest variables is modelled to be internally consistent and reliable, that is, manifest variables related to a factor measure “consistently” a unique theoretical construct. This feature implies that manifest variables are concordant (positively correlated) with the related factor and, therefore, the associated factor loadings are constrained to be nonnegative. A cyclic block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to maximize the likelihood. We present a simulation study that investigates the ability to get reliable factors. Furthermore, the new model is  applied to identify the underlying factors of well-being showing the characteristics of the new methodology. A final discussion completes the paper.</em></p>

<strong>Hierarchical Disjoint Principal Component Analysis</strong><br>
<em>Hierarchical Disjoint Principal Component Analysis}. Dimensionality reduction, by means of principal component analysis (PCA), is often employed to obtain a reduced space in which components, i.e. non-observable variables, synthesise as much information as possible detected by the original variables. In the specialized literature, several authors have extended PCA by obtaining disjoint subsets of manifest variables in order to improve the component interpretation. It implies that the resulting components are not orthogonal. Thus, it might be relevant inspecting their underlying interrelation structure. In this paper, a new methodology called Hierarchical Disjoint Principal Component Analysis (HDPCA) is proposed. It aims at building a set of variable partitions with respect to a decreasing number of non-overlapping groups, say a hierarchy, each one associated to a single component. Indeed, HDPCA extends the Disjoint Principal Component Analysis (DPCA) to find out about different grades of syntheses, from the lowest level of the hierarchy upwards. The methodology is formulated in a semi-parametric least-squares framework and a coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to estimate the model parameters. A simulation study and a real application are illustrated to highlight the empirical properties of the HDPCA.</em></p>

<strong>Composite indicators for climate change domains and their nested relations in the European Union</strong><br>
<em>Climate change is a compelling topic in public debate because of the risks in human life. The main causes of this phenomenon pertain human activities, e.g., industrial processes, energy consumption by fossil fuels, agricultural exploitation of lands, and an urgent global action to combat these changes is needed. The UNECE Task Force on a set of key Climate Change-related Statistics, as other international initiatives (e.g., the Sustainable Development Goals), has grouped policy questions concerning climate change into 5 main areas (domains) which represent its human causes and the efforts to avoid its consequences, as well as its impact on natural systems. In this paper, a new analysis of the nested relationships among the aforementioned areas via a hierarchical model-based composite indicator construction is presented by analysing in-depth the causes and the efforts to combat climate change of the 28 European Countries. A ranking of countries is provided and an in-depth study of the sources of pollution per country is carried out in order to pinpoint domains which address policies to.</em></p>

<strong>MATLAB package for Clustering Disjoint Principal Component Analysis with Cross-loadings and Constraints on Units, Variables and Components</strong><br>
<em>A MATLAB package for the least-squares estimation of the model Clustering and Disjoint Principal Component Analysis is proposed. The package is written in order to root for the researcher in all steps of his/her analysis. Some additional options are presented to conduct confirmatory analysis by pre-specifying, via constraints, the association between some variables and some components, and/or pre-specifying the belonging of some units to some clusters, very useful, for example, in case units are territories and cluster are necessarily formed by contiguous territories. Other options are given in order to increase the goodness of fit of the model by adding cross-loadings. Moreover, it is possible to request that all loadings are non-negative, in order to avoid compensated components, i.e., formed by variables with negative and positive loading that with their combination tend to compensate effects. Simulated examples are given to show the features of the package.</em></p>

<strong>Hierachical Means Clustering</strong><br>
<em>In the cluster analysis literature there are several partitioning (non-hierarchical) methods for clustering multivariate objects that are based on a model estimation by using methods such as least-squares, maximum likelihood, and weighted least-squares. The distinctive feature of these methods is the use of a statistical model (i.e., a model including a random variable representing the measurement error) for the reconstruction of the data and the optimization of a loss function for finding the best clustering model, in terms of the estimation method, fitting the observed data. Many hierarchical clustering methods are not model based. The hierarchy is obtained by means of a divisive or agglomerative greedy procedure. In addition, many hierarchical clustering methods operate on a objects by objects dissimilarity matrix and few of them use directly object by variable data matrix. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a novel method called Hierarchical Means Clustering (HMC) that extends K-means to the case of hierarchical clustering by producing a set of nested partitions with a centroid-based model, estimated via least squares. As K-means, HMC operates on object by variable data. However, it produces a hierarchy that is formed by n nested partitions into one to n clusters with minimal total cluster deviance. The HMC corresponds to K-means in the case no hierarchy is required. In addition, the HMC can be estimated for a limited number of partitions, say from 1 to K with K&lt;n, thereby defining a parsimonious tree, that is, the best centroid-based model for nested partitions into 1 to K clusters. Several interesting relations between HMC, Ward’s method, and bisecting K-means are discussed.</em></p>
